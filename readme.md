# Logivance – Backend

This repository contains the **backend service** for the school project **Logivance**, a logistics platform for climate-controlled and traceable delivery of specialized goods. The backend handles data management, authentication, sensor communication, vehicle integration, and provides REST APIs for both the frontend and IoT systems.

> **Note:** The Azure backend, database, frontend, and monitoring have been decommissioned. The backend can now only be run **locally** using Docker and PostgreSQL.

## Docker Images

We maintain **latest dev and main images** on Docker Hub:

- Repository: [chasadvancegroup4/chas_advance_backend](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chasadvancegroup4/chas_advance_backend/general)

Develop images always have same major tag as main, with updates on minor. To get precised version, check version file in github to download correct image.  
Develop images also gets pushed with latest tag, so if you want the latest image published go with latest tag.
```bash 
# Pull latest dev image
docker pull chasadvancegroup4/chas_advance_backend:latest  
docker pull chasadvancegroup/chas_advance_backend:2.5  2.10 ...   
````

Main images always have tag major.0, to use the latest, check version file in github and use major number.0.  
```bash
# Pull latest main image  
docker pull chasadvancegroup4/chas_advance_backend:2.0   3.0 ...  
````

## Future Improvements

* Expand logging and metrics for better observability.
* Optimize database queries and connection pooling.
* Increase unit and integration test coverage.
* Improve CI/CD with automated rollback for failed deployments.
* Extend docstrings and Doxygen comments for all services and models.
* Introduce stricter rate limiting and advanced authentication flows.
* Introduce environment-specific configs for staging and production.
* Refactor control unit architecture to support multiple sensor units dynamically instead of hardcoded connections.
* Extend data model and backend APIs to handle GPS data and other future sensor types.
* Refactor backend towards a more modular microservice architecture for improved scalability and maintainability.
* Refactor backend so all endpoints are secured behind login authorization and delete unused endpoints
